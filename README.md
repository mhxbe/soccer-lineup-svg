# Soccer Lineup SVG

A NodeJS endpoint for generating a soccer lineup in svg image by passing through a url in a specific format.

## Rationale

I was pitching this vague idea to my awesome colleague, Rob, and he immediately was brainstorming along.

## How to test?

- `npm install`
- `npm start` // spins up a server with nodemon
- Open browser and surf to `http://localhost:9069/lineup?formation=433&players=1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11`

## Url

Currenlty, the testing url is `http://localhost:9069/lineup?formation=433&players=1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11`. This will probably change once we optimize this app.
